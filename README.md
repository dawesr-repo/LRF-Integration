# LRF-Fortran

## Important files
* production file:     production (The compiled version of the code)
* how_to_use_it file (min_example.f90):  File that shows the simplest way to call the subroutine

## Relevant features
* Inclusion of Mod Introduction of FitConstants Module to deal with multiple coefficient files at the same time
* Improvement in the subroutine performance ( running time reduced somewhere between 60% to 80% )
* Reforming Multipoles files to min_example ( minimal calling function structure)
